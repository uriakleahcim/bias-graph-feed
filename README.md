# Bias Graph Feed

### A self-hosted news-ingestion API with multi-source grouping and local LLM analysis

> **TL;DR:** Bias Graph Feed pulls news from multiple sources, groups related articles into stories, scores outlet bias, and generates local AI summaries and deeper reports on your own hardware.

The legacy browser presentation was intentionally removed.  The service now
publishes a small local JSON API for a native dashboard; see
[the Agent Bar API contract](docs/agent-bar-api.md).

## Why This Is Different

Most aggregators are just article lists. Bias Graph Feed is story-first.

- **Cross-outlet story grouping**: related coverage from multiple publishers is clustered into a single story so you can compare framing side by side.
- **Bias visibility**: outlets are labeled on a left-to-right scale using AllSides where available and local model scoring otherwise.
- **Local-first AI analysis**: summaries, deep reports, topic classification, and outlet scoring run against your own Ollama models by default. Gemini, Groq, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (OpenRouter, DeepSeek, OpenAI, a local vLLM) are supported alternatives, and the two workloads can be split across providers — see LLM behavior below.
- **Edition workflow**: the system can publish fixed-size headline editions from the broader story pool instead of leaving everything as a raw reverse-chronological feed.
- **Self-hosted**: no subscription requirement, no ad-tech, and no mandatory third-party cloud inference.

## What It Does

Bias Graph Feed fetches articles from multiple news APIs and RSS feeds on a schedule, scrapes article text, groups related coverage into stories, classifies topics, scores outlet bias, and generates summaries or deeper reports when content is ready. It includes admin tooling for scrape review, retries, regrouping, and monitoring scrape health over time.

## Security Warning

By default every page requires a login. The app is built as a private admin tool, so even with public read access turned on (below), don't expose it directly to the public internet.

Recommended deployment:
- keep the admin interface on a local network
- or put it behind a VPN such as WireGuard or Tailscale

---

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose (PostgreSQL and Meilisearch run as part of the stack)
- An Ollama endpoint with the configured model profile. The Sandbox Protocol
  deployment provides one shared, loopback-only endpoint.
- Optional: NewsAPI and GNews API keys. Each source is skipped if its key is unset; RSS feeds work without either.

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uriakleahcim/bias-graph-feed.git
cd bias-graph-feed
./install.sh
```

The first run creates `.env` from `.env.sample` and stops so you can fill in
your API keys and database secrets. Start the configured shared Ollama endpoint
first, then run it again — it builds the core services and starts the scheduler.
Safe to re-run: on an existing install it applies any
pending migrations rather than skipping them.
(A very old install with tables but no migration history stops with
instructions instead of guessing its schema version.)

After the stack starts, verify it from the host with
`curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/health`.  The API remains loopback-only;
it is intended for a local dashboard client, not public exposure.

<details>
<summary>Manual steps (if you'd rather not use install.sh)</summary>

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
# Edit .env with API keys and secrets
docker compose up -d --build postgres meilisearch app
docker compose exec app python bootstrap_database.py
docker compose up -d scheduler
```

</details>

If you pull schema changes later:

```bash
docker exec muckscraper-app-1 flask db upgrade
```

**Upgrading within a major version (e.g. `1.x` → `1.y`) never breaks your
stored config or customizations** — topics, RSS feeds, prompts, scheduled
fetches, and ingestion blocks you've edited stay as you left them.
Config-breaking changes are reserved for major version bumps (`1.x` →
`2.0`) and always called out explicitly in that release's `CHANGELOG.md`
entry, never shipped silently in a minor/patch upgrade.

### Optional workflow integrations

Bias Graph Feed can be extended with personal workflow hooks, such as n8n webhooks for fetch reports or Ollama power management, and Matrix notifications for status messages. These are not part of the default Docker Compose setup; add them with your own environment variables, compose override, or notification code if you want those workflows.

---

## Customization

### Topics, feeds, queries, prompts, filters, and schedule

All DB-backed and admin-editable, no code change needed:
- Topics: `/admin/topics`
- RSS feeds: `/admin/rss-feeds`
- LLM prompts: `/admin/prompts` (each resettable back to its original default)
- Pipeline run schedule — *when* fetch-only vs. full-pipeline runs happen: `/admin/pipeline-schedule`
- Scheduled fetches — *what* each run pulls from NewsAPI/GNews: `/admin/scheduled-fetches`
- Ingestion blocklist — sources and headline keywords refused before anything is
  stored: `/admin/ingestion-blocks`

The shipped defaults reflect the maintainer's reading habits — US-centric topics,
a gaming-news filter — but they are defaults now rather than the only option, so
adapting the project to a different beat no longer means a fork.

### LLM behavior

**Choosing a provider (`LLM_PROVIDER`).** Ollama is the default and the point of
the project, but `LLM_PROVIDER` also accepts `gemini`, `groq`, and `openrouter`.
The OpenRouter path is a generic OpenAI-compatible client — set `OPENROUTER_HOST`
to any endpoint speaking `chat/completions` (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Together, a local
vLLM) and it works with no code change. Embeddings are a separate axis
(`EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`) and only Ollama and Gemini can serve them; Groq has no
embedding models and OpenRouter routes chat completions only.

**Splitting the two workloads (`LLM_FAST_PROVIDER`).** A run makes ~1,140
mechanical calls against ~65 summary/deep-report calls (see below). Those two
groups can go to *different* providers, which is the answer to "my GPU can't run
a model good enough for summaries":

```
LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter      # the ~65 summaries and deep reports
LLM_FAST_PROVIDER=ollama     # the ~1,140 grouping/classification/bias calls
```

The volume stays local and free; only the handful of calls a reader actually
sees go to the cloud. Note the ordering reads backwards from "send simple things
to Ollama" — the global is the cloud provider and Ollama is the exception —
because that is the only arrangement where leaving `LLM_FAST_PROVIDER` blank
keeps single-provider installs behaving exactly as before.

Health checks are per-tier, so the pipeline degrades rather than stops: if the
local box is asleep, summaries still run and only classification is skipped, and
vice versa.

**Model tiers (`OLLAMA_FAST_MODEL`).** A full pipeline run makes roughly 1,200
sequential LLM calls, and about 1,140 of them are mechanical — story-grouping
confirmations, topic classification, headline generation, outlet bias — whose
output is a label, a yes/no, or a short headline. Only ~65 are the summaries and
deep reports a reader actually sees. Setting `OLLAMA_FAST_MODEL` to a smaller
model routes the mechanical calls to it while summaries stay on `OLLAMA_MODEL`.

This matters most when `OLLAMA_MODEL` is too large for your GPU. Compare
`size_vram` against `size` in `curl $OLLAMA_HOST/api/ps` — if `size_vram` is
smaller, the rest is running on CPU and every call pays for it. Worse, a model
that fills the card leaves no room for the embedding model, so Ollama swaps the
two in and out on every article. A fast model that fits alongside
`nomic-embed-text` avoids both problems.

Leave it blank to use `OLLAMA_MODEL` for everything (the original behavior).
`GEMINI_FAST_MODEL` and `GROQ_FAST_MODEL` do the same for those providers.

Prompt wording itself is editable at `/admin/prompts` (see above) with no
code change needed. The surrounding logic — persona/analysis-type
selection, story-grouping thresholds, etc. — still lives in:
- `news_fetcher/summarizer.py`
- `news_fetcher/topic_classifier.py`
- `news_fetcher/story_grouper.py`
- `news_fetcher/headline_generator.py`
- `news_fetcher/outlet_bias_llm.py`
- `news_fetcher/allsides_lookup.py` (bias data source)

### Scrape and grouping tuning

Important knobs include:
- similarity thresholds in `news_fetcher/story_grouper.py`
- heuristic ingest filters (roundup/advice-column/betting title patterns) in
  `aggregator/article_signals.py` — the source and headline-keyword blocklists
  themselves are admin-editable at `/admin/ingestion-blocks`
- retry and cooldown behavior in `news_fetcher/scraper.py`

## Notes

- This repo intentionally documents the main application and ingestion pipeline, not every deployment-specific integration.
- Optional local integrations can exist around the core stack without being required for the open-source app itself.
