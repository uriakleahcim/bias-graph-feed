    Only fires when *both* sides name a recognized country; most articles
    don't, so this can't veto the majority of matches, and an unrecognized
    or ambiguous country name (see COUNTRY_TOKENS) only ever costs a missed
    veto, never a wrong one.

    Overlap guard added 2026-09-27. Disjoint country sets are NOT evidence of a
    different story: one event is routinely described with different countries
    ("Fiery Netanyahu vows *Iran's* demise" vs "*Netanyahu* faces isolation",
    whose {israel} comes from its headline). Measured over all 31 firings in 17
    days of retained logs, 21 wrongly split a single event -- an entire UN
    speech, the BRICS summit and the Okinawa election were each split from
    themselves. So if the two titles share any meaningful token, the subject is
    the same and the country difference is ignored.

    Replayed against those 31 firings before shipping: of the 29 whose article
    could be reliably attributed, this suppresses 21 and leaves 8 -- including
    both firings confirmed correct by hand (a UK front-pages roundup vs a Diana
    book theft, and an Israeli hostage musician vs Ed Sheeran's Gaza remarks),
    which share no tokens at all.

    KNOWN RISK, watch for this: "any shared token" is deliberately loose, and
    some suppressions in the replay rested on weak tokens ('oil', 'parts',
    'who'/'are'/'but' -- the last three survive TITLE_STOPWORDS today). That is
    the same shared-boilerplate hole this veto was built to close, so if
    chimeras start reappearing on generic phrases, tighten this before widening
    it. Tightening by requiring 2+ shared tokens does NOT work -- it loses the
    two cleanest wins, Netanyahu and Okinawa, which share exactly one highly
    distinctive token each. Rank tokens by distinctiveness instead.

Existing stories:

Does this article cover the same specific event or ongoing situation as any of the stories listed above?

Rules:
- Match if they are clearly about the same specific event or continuing storyline, even when the new article is an update, explainer, reaction, evacuation step, casualty update, or human-interest angle on that same event
- Do not match just because they share a broad topic or the same company/person/country
- Do not match if the stories contradict each other (e.g. "price drop" vs "price increase")
- Do not match broad opinion or analysis to a news event unless it is explicitly anchored to that same concrete event or ongoing situation
- Use the context snippets to distinguish between similar-sounding but different events{incumbent_rule}
- If it matches, respond with only the number of the matching story (e.g. "2")
- If it does not match any story, respond with only "0"
- Respond with a single number and nothing else

Examples of correct NON-matches (should return 0):
- "Meta announces layoffs" vs "Epic Games lays off 900 workers" -> 0 (different companies, different events)
- "Measles outbreak in Michigan" vs "Measles outbreak in Washington state" -> 0 (same disease, different locations)
- "UFC fighter suspended for PED use" vs "MLB player suspended for PED use" -> 0 (different sports, different athletes)
- "iPhone security alert" vs "Chrome zero-day vulnerability" -> 0 (different platforms, different vulnerabilities)
- "NPR funding ruling" vs "Pentagon press policy ruling" -> 0 (different court cases)
- "Grocery chain closing 17 stores" vs "Restaurant chain closing locations" -> 0 (different companies)
- "Gold prices fall amid Iran war" vs "Trump says no ceasefire with Iran" -> 0 (different topics: finance vs diplomacy)
- "How the Iran war affects trade recovery" vs "Iranian official killed in strike" -> 0 (analysis piece vs news event)"""
