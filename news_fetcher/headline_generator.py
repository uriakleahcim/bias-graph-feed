# Headlines are the exception to the "mechanical calls go on the fast tier"
# rule: they are mechanical, but they are also the most reader-visible text on
# the site. On TIER_FAST the 8B model twice published invented figures --
# "1.7M ladders" became "Over 17 million" (2026-08-07), and "4 savings account
# options" became "$4 in interest" (2026-08-10, edition 281 rank 11). Prompt
# hardening fixed the padding but not the comprehension errors.
#
# This is only affordable because headlines are generated in ONE batch pass
# (generate_headlines_for_stale_stories, below) positioned immediately before
# the summary phase, which loads the same quality model anyway -- so the run
# pays zero extra model swaps. Ollama holds one model at a time; generating
# these inline per article on a different tier from grouping/classification
# would swap models on every story and cost roughly 40 minutes a run.
HEADLINE_TIER = llm_client.TIER_QUALITY

# How far back the per-run pass looks. Long enough to cover stories still
# accumulating articles, short enough that the pass does not walk the whole
# ~10k-story table every run.
